# not tickles
A discord bot called "not tickles" with many random features.

How to use:
- Download the repository,
- Set up a discord bot ([instructions](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)).
  - This bot was made for fun so I do not have a remote host, and I am only hosting it locally when testing.
- (Optional) To use Wargaming API, create an API key ([here](https://developers.wargaming.net/applications)).
- Put necessary API keys in `bot_secrets.py`
- Run the bot with `python3 main.py`.
